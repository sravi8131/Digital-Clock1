# Digital-Clock1
The "Simple Digital Clock" project is a basic web application that displays a digital clock on a web page. The clock is designed to show the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating in real-time without requiring manual page refreshes. This project demonstrates the fundamental use of HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior.
